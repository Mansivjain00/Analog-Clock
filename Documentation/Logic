Analog Clock

i. Hour Hand
ii. Minute Hand
iii. Second Hand

Logic:

i. Hour hand

For 12 hours, we rotate 360 degrees
Therefore for 1 hour = 360/12=30 degrees;

Therefore, for h hours you need to rotate by 30h degrees

But, we also have to take minutes into consideration.

60 minutes = 30 degrees rotation
1 minute = 30/60 = 1/2 degrees
For m minutes = m/2 degrees

Therefore for h hours and m minutes= (30h + m/2) degrees rotation

it will move because of the second hand too, but that will be negligible.

ii. Minute Hand

For 60 minutes , we rotate 360 degrees
Therefore for 1 minute = 6 degrees;
For m minutes = 6m degrees rotation.


We will ignore the effect of seconds hand as it is negligible.

iii. Second Hand

60 seconds = 360 degrees rotation
1 second = 6 degrees 
Therefore in s seconds= 6s degrees

Important  Formulae:

Rotation Formulae
i. Formula 1(Hour hand): (30h +(m/2)) degrees;
ii. Formula 2(Minute hand): 6m degrees;
iii. Formula 3(Second hand): 6s degrees;
